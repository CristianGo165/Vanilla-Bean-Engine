# Vanilla-Bean-Engine
This project is graphics/game engine made in Java that utilizes Swing. It started as a project for an AP CS Principles project, but I have decided to continue development on the engine as a personal project of mine. The engine should primarily be used to make simple games or projects which require a basic user interface.
